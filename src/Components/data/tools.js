These extra rotors can make it easier for the craft to maintain its balance and keep hovering.' },
    { key: 2, name: 'Fixed-Wing Hybrid Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VTOL-UAV-prototype-NASA.jpg', price: 20500, description: 'This types of drone attempt to take the best from fixed-wing and rotor-based designs, making for drones that feature both. A fixed-wing hybrid drone will tend to have a couple rotors attached to the ends of fixed wings.' },
    { key: 3, name: 'Small Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DJI-Mavic-Pro.jpg', price: 20300, description: 'These drones are strictly recreational and usually cannot perform many of the commercial functions of which some of those other models are capable. For example, when properly mounted, cameras onboard highly stable multi-rotor can capture stunning aerial pictures and video.' },
    { key: 4, name: 'Micro Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Micro-Drone-U.S.-Air-Force.jpg', price: 22000, description: 'While smaller drones may mean recreation in the eyes of consumers, for militaries who use drones, micro drones are all business. The most well-known example of this type of drone in action today is the Black Hornet, manufactured for the British military.' },
    { key: 5, name: 'Tactical Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Raven-UAV-flying.jpg', price: 20080, description: 'The units come with onboard GPS technology. While they are on the simple side and do not boast a lot of bells and whistles, this also makes them quite accessible and easy for soldiers to use without the need for special training.' },
    { key: 6, name: 'Non-Combat Large Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-Hawk-Drone.jpg', price: 20900, description: 'By contrast, there are large drones that are not meant to be used in combat. These can take on a variety of jobs, often reconnaissance, and are used for more large-scale recon missions than their miniscule Black Hornet and Raven counterparts.' },
    { key: 7, name: 'GPS Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DJI-phantom-4-GPS-Drone.jpg', price: 30000, description: 'These drones work by linking up to satellites via a GPS hookup. They are then able to use this as a means of mapping out the rest of their flight, creating data that you can then extract and use for your own purposes. ' },
    { key: 8, name: 'Photography Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/U.S.-Air-Force-aerial-intelligence-drone.jpg', price: 9000, description: 'If you are looking to take professional-grade shots, you will want to make sure that your drone is outfitted with a professional-grade camera. High-resolution pictures can be taken with 4K camera drones. Some photography drones also make use of precision stability and automated flight modes for taking pictures over vast spaces.' },
    { key: 9, name: 'Racing Drones', img: 'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Racing-Drone.jpg', price: 10000, description: 'Racing drones can reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. That said, all of that power concentrated on a single purpose means that they often donâ€™t enjoy the same longevity of flight time as their counterparts.' },
    {key:10,name:'Single-Rotor Drones',img:'https://aerocorner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Northrop-Grummans-RQ-8-Fire-Scout-UAV.jpg',price:30000,description:'These are by far some of the most basic types of drones. As the name would imply, it employs only a single rotor (besides the tail unit in some cases) and can often generate thrust more efficiently than their multi-rotor counterparts. This can make them ideal for longer flight times.'},
